# Data-Analytics-RideShare-Case-study
This Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, Case Study 1, centers around the examination of Cyclistic's bike share data for a fictitious bike-share company. 
The primary objective of this project is to explore the bike share user’s ride patterns and behaviors in order to enhance marketing strategies and boost annual subscriptions. 
Leveraging data analysis techniques and tools, the project endeavors to reveal significant insights that can inform business decisions and enhance Cyclistic's overall performance.

Case Study Context:
Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering in 2006. And has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles. These bikes are geo-tracked and locked in a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the network at any time. Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments including flexible pricing plans. 
Cyclistic offers single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. “Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as CASUAL riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are MEMBERS. 

Business Objective:
The main objective of this study is to analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and the primary distinction in bike usage and behavior between two types of users.
"Casual" riders who pay for individual rides or full-day passes. "Members" who subscribe annually to access the service.
And identify how to convert casual riders into annual members by identifying key differences in how Cyclistic riders operate the service in Chicago.

Using the historical data to answer the following questions:
    How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
